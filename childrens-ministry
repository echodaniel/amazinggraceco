# Childrens Ministry

At AGCC, you will find an environment that teaches and includes
children rather than babysit or push to the sidelines.


*We invite children to stay in service with us, but we also provide
separate children's church we call **Discipleship Training.**

We can pick up your children and give them a ride to church.
Just ask.*

**Mission Statement**

Present the salvation message and teach spiritual truths from the word of God,
under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

**Vision Statement**

Every child will grow in faith and love of God, making godly choices as young people
committed to Jesus Christ.

**Ministry Vision**

Evangelism: "Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them,
for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" Matthew 19:14

Discipleship: "Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it." Proverbs 22:6

Relationship: "All your children shall be taught by the Lord, And great shall be the peace of your children." Isaiah 54:13

Encouragement: "Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good." 1 Corinthians 12:7

**Four Corner Posts**

* The Word of God - alive and active
* The Holy Spirit - Teacher, Helper, Wisdom
* Prayer - For the pastor, the church, the teachers and the children
* Unity - Teachers united in faith and purpose, love and grace under the umbrella of Amazing Grace Community Church.

**Personal Ministry**

*"â€¦the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who was given to us." **Romans 5:5***

Praise God my Savior Who motivates and enables us to serve Him through the power of His love.
