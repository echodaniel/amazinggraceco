# Live & Love Like Jesus

**Why Should You Consider Attending Amazing Grace CC?**


*I’m not a believer, but curious…*

You are heartily invited to attend! We are a grace-filled church where you can be open and unafraid to admit you have questions or don’t believe. Even during the service! You won’t be ‘judged’ and you will be given freedom to learn at your own pace. You won't be hounded for money either.

We ALL have a past. But we are more concerned with your future. We don’t try to get people to give up their uniqueness and become a ‘cookie-cutter’ Christian.

You’ll likely be pleasantly surprised.



*I’m a Believer looking for a church that ‘walks the talk’…*

We are a church that does not follow traditional church format. We are much more concerned with emulating Jesus and the early church found in Acts. To that end, we do not talk about politics or have man-made rules and traditions or put on a show or teach from popular teachings. We use the bible. We are more of a church in a mission-field. We help the poor, the abandoned, the homeless, the fatherless, the widows and orphans. We endeavor to be known as a giving church, giving out to those who come in need and to the community around us. We have a pastor but we are strongly a community.

Come find out what community looks like.



*I’m a Believer that would like to be involved in Community and Hands-On Ministry…*

Attending church here is not a passive event or a place to hide in the rear pews. Largely because we sit in a circle! It’s a place to engage and get to know one-another. Our service is purposed in ministering to one-another and building relationships. Attendance here opens up many opportunities to use your spiritual gifts. You’ll have time to disciple others, pray for others, help others in need, even be part of a personal ministry or leadership.

You no longer have to just hear sermons about doing the word, you’ll have opportunity to do it!



**At AGCC, you will find an environment that teaches the
Bible and talks a lot about Jesus.**

We believe that the entire Bible is God’s message of how man can have a right relationship with God; therefore, the message of the gospel and Jesus is the focus of our teaching. At any given time, you will find that we are teaching through a book of the Bible in a verse by verse format. We also talk a lot about loving one-another, how to be grace-givers, how to respond to those grace-growers in our life.

Come and be part of a community dedicated to helping people understand the Bible and how to love others like Jesus.


**Community Reach**
We live life together in community. It’s crazy, but we have to do it intentionally because, naturally, our lives are independent instead of interdependent.

We believe that as part of our God-design, we are meant to both enjoy relationships and grow through them. We pursue deep community where people live life with each other: sharing meals, meeting needs, hanging out, mourning, and celebrating together.

We believe the gospel, the good news that God is restoring all of creation to himself through Jesus, is a Story that changes every part of our lives. This story is about restored relationship to God, so we live in such a way as a community that we engage with God together through regular times of learning from the Bible, prayer, and worship.

*There’s nothing like the feel of this place on Sunday Morning!*
